# Woffice Updater (Unyson extension)

## Files : 

* **woffice-updater/** : the Unyson extension that you need to use in your theme's files (framework-customizations/extensions/)
* **server/** : the files on your server 

## Notes : 

* This is a first version
* It may be better to use the functions in server/theme-updater.php in a class
* It's also connected to an online service : alka-web.com/woffice-updater/ This is why there is different cases in "theme-updater.php"
